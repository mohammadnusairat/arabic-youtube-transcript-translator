# System Design: Arabic YouTube Transcript Translator

## Implementation approach

Based on the PRD, I'll design a scalable and efficient architecture for the Arabic YouTube Transcript Translator application. The system will handle the entire pipeline from YouTube URL input to the generation of translated, timestamped documents.

### Difficult points and solutions:

1. **Arabic Speech Recognition**: Using Microsoft's MarkItDown library for transcription offers a significant advantage, as it's specifically designed to convert audio to markdown with timestamps. We'll implement it via Docker or direct Python API integration.

2. **Translation Quality**: To ensure high-quality translations while balancing costs, we'll implement OpenAI's ChatGPT API with carefully designed prompts that preserve timing information and context.

3. **Processing Pipeline**: The system needs to handle multiple stages of processing (URL validation, audio extraction, transcription, translation, document generation) with proper status tracking and error handling.

4. **Scalability**: We'll implement a queue-based architecture with Redis to manage concurrent processing requests and ensure the system can scale horizontally.

### Selected frameworks and libraries:

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for efficient API development
- **Video Processing**: yt-dlp for YouTube video/audio extraction
- **Transcription**: Microsoft MarkItDown library
- **Translation**: OpenAI ChatGPT API
- **PDF Generation**: Pandoc with wkhtmltopdf
- **Queue Management**: Redis for job queues and caching
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment and MarkItDown integration

## Data structures and interfaces

The application's data model will be structured as follows:

### Core Classes

1. **VideoProcessor**: Handles YouTube video validation and audio extraction
2. **TranscriptionService**: Manages the transcription process using MarkItDown
3. **TranslationService**: Manages the translation process using ChatGPT API
4. **DocumentGenerator**: Creates PDF and MD files from translated transcripts
5. **JobManager**: Coordinates the overall processing pipeline and tracks job status

The backend will expose RESTful APIs for frontend interactions, and we'll use WebSockets for real-time progress updates.

## Program call flow

The program flow involves several key stages:

1. User submits YouTube URL through the frontend
2. Backend validates URL and creates a processing job
3. Video processor extracts audio from the YouTube video
4. Transcription service processes the audio to generate Arabic transcript
5. Translation service converts Arabic transcript to English
6. Document generator creates PDF and MD files
7. Files are made available for download
8. User is notified of completion

The system will provide real-time progress updates throughout this process.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **API Rate Limits**: The PRD doesn't specify expected usage patterns. We should establish rate limits and caching strategies based on expected traffic.

2. **Storage Requirements**: We need to determine how long processed files should be stored before deletion. The system could either store files temporarily (e.g., 24 hours) or implement user accounts for persistent storage.

3. **Error Handling Specifics**: While the PRD mentions error handling, specific recovery strategies for different failure modes (e.g., YouTube API limitations, MarkItDown processing errors) should be detailed further.

4. **Authentication Requirements**: The PRD mentions basic authentication for API access but doesn't specify if user registration/login is required for the MVP. We've designed assuming minimal authentication initially.

5. **Deployment Environment**: Further details on the target deployment environment would help refine the infrastructure recommendations.
