**[00:00]** In the name of Allah. And indeed, all praise is due to Allah.

**[00:03]** We praise Him, seek His help, ask for His forgiveness, and seek His guidance.

**[00:10]** And we seek refuge in Allah from the evil within ourselves and from the consequences of our deeds.

**[00:15]** Whomever Allah guides is truly guided.

**[00:18]** And whoever is led astray has indeed suffered manifest loss.

**[00:23]** And I bear witness that there is no god but Allah.

**[00:26]** He is One, without any partner.

**[00:29]** The abode of Islamic law.

**[00:32]** And in it, He has placed a cure for every illness.

**[00:37]** And for every ailment, a remedy, and for every matter, a decree by His permission, Glorified is He.

**[00:44]** The speaker and his truthful words, and we want to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed on earth, and make them leaders, and make them the inheritors, and grant them power on earth, and show Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers, some of what they used to fear.

**[01:04]** And peace and blessings upon the beloved of Allah and our beloved, our master, our leader, our role model, the bearer of our banner, the yearning of our hearts, our master Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.

**[01:16]** The one who said, "Do not fight the Jews, so do not kill them." You spoke the truth, my beloved. O Abul-Qasim. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest, and there is no power except with Allah.

**[01:31]** And Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. And there is no victory except from Allah. Allah is the Greatest.

**[01:39]** Honor belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, but the hypocrites do not know.

**[01:45]** And after the servants of God.

**[01:48]** Our Lord, the Almighty, says.

**[01:51]** There the believers were tested and shaken severely.

**[01:57]** And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease say.

**[02:01]** Allah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion.

**[02:06]** Servants of God.

**[02:08]** Whenever the clamor rises.

**[02:12]** And the days of patience lengthen.

**[02:16]** And the enemies' horses roam and wander among the believers' horses.

**[02:21]** A group emerges among the Muslims.

**[02:25]** A group of people, their hearts are believers, Muslims, but their hearts are diseased, there is something in them, and another group, they are sick with hypocrisy, their aim is to destroy the nation from within, before the enemy destroys it from the outside.

**[02:42]** The first claims of these two groups of God's servants is to cast doubt on the promise of Allah, the Almighty, and His power.

**[02:50]** So who says, "Where is your Lord?" regarding Gaza, the Almighty? Concerning what they describe? Does our Lord not see what is happening in Gaza? Is our Lord not jealous, the Almighty? So where is His jealousy for the women of Gaza? And where is His jealousy for the children of Gaza? And where is His jealousy for the blood of Gaza?

**[03:12]** And who says, "Do you not call upon Allah, the Almighty?"

**[03:18]** And you persist in supplicating to Him? So why has your Lord, the Almighty, delayed in responding to you?

**[03:25]** Here we say, O servants of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to Satan, "Get away from me, Satan! Do you think I will test my Lord?" We do not test our Lord, O people. What is happening in Gaza is not a test for Allah, but it is a test for us, O servants of Allah. What is happening in Gaza is a test for us, the servants of Allah, and not a test for Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He.

**[03:51]** The responsibility for what is happening in Gaza lies with us, the Islamic nation, and not with Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, the Almighty.

**[03:59]** He created us, commanded us, and sent us down to the earth as a test for us, so that we may see what we do. Do not think for a moment that Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, will leave us unchallenged, steadfast, and fight the battle on our behalf.

**[04:15]** If Allah were to fight the battle on behalf of anyone.

**[04:18]** Or instead of anyone, He would have fought the battle on behalf of Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Do not think that we will prevail through miracles or the unseen. If there were someone to prevail through a miracle, it would be Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. And do not think that what you see before you is a test for Allah, but it is a test for us, O servants of Allah. A test for our faith.

**[04:45]** A test of our loyalty to this religion. A test of our manhood, a test of our courage, a test of the truth of our existence.

**[04:54]** Therefore, Muhammad carried the sword with the blessings and peace of my Lord upon him.

**[04:59]** If there was another way to achieve victory other than carrying the sword and striving in the path of Allah, he would have done so with the blessings and peace of his Lord upon him.

**[05:08]** So, to those who ask where is Allah in Gaza? We say to them, where are you in Gaza? What is happening in Gaza is not a test from our Lord, but a test for us.

**[05:18]** What is happening in Gaza will not end with a miracle, but it will end when sincere men move with their arms, swords, and weapons.

**[05:28]** This is the first statement, O servants.

**[05:31]** Then the second statement we say is that we know that we are a nation of goodness.

**[05:36]** It is enough that Allah, the Almighty, still carries us with the Quran, and this is the greatest evidence that we are a nation of goodness. Anyone who doubts this nation is doubting Allah, the Almighty, because if there was a better nation than this one, Allah would have given them the Quran instead of us, right?

**[05:55]** If Allah knew that there was a nation better than us, He would have taken the Quran away from us and given it to them. Do you doubt the decision of Allah, the Almighty?

**[06:04]** This is a nation of goodness by the decree and command of Allah.

**[06:08]** Whoever sees the good, Allah has opened it for him, and whoever does not see the good, Allah has blinded his heart and insight. This is a nation of goodness that we will not doubt.

**[06:16]** What happens then?

**[06:19]** A nation of goodness? Where is its goodness? And where is its virtue?

**[06:22]** Five months? Servants of Allah? Jewish children are slaughtered, our children are preyed upon, they amuse themselves with killing our children, women, and men in Gaza. The situation has reached the point where people die of hunger and cold. So where is the goodness in this nation? And why isn't goodness moving in this nation? I tell you, where are the servants?

**[06:43]** This nation has afflicted its men or its men with diseases.

**[06:48]** The first of these diseases is that each one of us, of course I am not speaking about the people of Palestine, the servants of God, because the people of Palestine are not responsible for the liberation of Palestine, and this is a religious ruling that is not from them.

**[07:01]** The liberation of Palestine is not our responsibility, O servants of God, our responsibility, according to legitimacy, is to persevere, stand firm, and adhere to our religion.

**[07:11]** The responsibility of liberating Palestine is the responsibility of those around us from the Muslims, if they do not know, this is what the people of Palestine are waiting for to liberate it, that Palestine will not be liberated from within, O servants of God, you are east of the river and they are west of Palestine, it will not be liberated from within.

**[07:26]** Palestine will only be liberated by an army from outside, and strength from outside, O servants of God, therefore the responsibility of the people of Palestine is to continue their steadfastness, resilience, and steadfastness in their religion, and to keep the flame of jihad burning, this is their mission.

**[07:40]** But the liberation of Palestine is the task of the Islamic nation around us, the problem now lies with the Islamic nation.

**[07:47]** All of them except those whom Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, has mercy upon, each one of them thinks that he is not the one responsible.

**[07:54]** And each one of them waits for someone else to take action.

**[07:58]** And each one of them thinks that he is not the one who bears the responsibility.

**[08:05]** So each worshipper of Allah waits for someone else to take action, each one of them in worship waits for someone else to accomplish, waits for someone else to take risks, waits for someone else to be at the forefront, and to progress.

**[08:18]** This is a serious matter, worshippers of Allah, the Islamic nation cannot move except in one condition.

**[08:25]** If every individual in the Islamic nation considers themselves as the main responsible for moving the nation forward.

**[08:31]** When it comes to liberating Palestine, and raising the banner of Islam, when you have this feeling, know that you have reached true faith, when you say you think you are the only main responsible for moving the Islamic nation forward.

**[08:46]** But if you want others to start while you watch.

**[08:50]** And you say, "I neither lead nor follow, I am just one of the people, not ahead nor behind, and others are stronger than me, better than me, faster than me." If you think in this way, this is the way of thinking of the cowards among God's servants. This is the way of thinking of the cowards.

**[09:06]** He who waits for others to take risks and move is a sitting, idle, content person, this is the way of thinking of the cowards, seeking refuge in God.

**[09:17]** The majority of Muslims, except for those whom Allah has mercy upon, wait for others to take action, and the last thing they think about is taking action themselves.

**[09:28]** When you are a Muslim, you must understand that you are the primary responsible one.

**[09:35]** On the Day of Judgment, Allah will not ask you why so-and-so did not take action, or why such-and-such did not take action. You, alone, will be asked. So when we say you are the primary responsible one, this is a word with its true meaning, O servants of Allah, because you will be asked before Allah why you did not free Palestine, why you did not save Gaza, why the people of Gaza are suffering, why the children of Gaza are in the cold. This question you will be specifically asked.

**[10:02]** Allah will not accept from you, and Allah will not respond to you if you say, "O Lord, what concern is it of mine? I was weak, and I am not responsible, someone else was stronger than me." No, you will answer this question. Therefore, each one of us, servants of Allah, is the primary responsible one and accountable before Allah, the Most High, the one who waits in the back rows for others to take action.

**[10:26]** This is cowardice, and we seek refuge in Allah. So, we seek refuge in Allah from cowardice.

**[10:30]** The second or third, servants of God, I want you to know a rule.

**[10:36]** Palestine will not be liberated except when the Islamic nation unites.

**[10:40]** This is all, drink to it, sleep on it, wake up to it, Palestine will not be liberated except when the Islamic nation unites.

**[10:49]** And this is the saying of Allah Almighty because when Allah Almighty informed us of entering the mosque.

**[10:56]** He did not speak about the people of Palestine or about this or that organization. I do not speak in the form of a group. He said, "And let him enter the mosque as they entered it the first time." Who were the ones who entered the mosque the first time? The Muslims led by Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him. These are the same Muslims, the descendants of their conquerors, addressed in the second entry, "And let him enter the mosque as they entered it the first time." Therefore, as long as the Sykes-Picot Agreement exists, servants of God, it is impossible for Palestine to be lost.

**[11:25]** Absolute impossibility, and this is what we say to our people outside Palestine, as long as you still cling to your nationalities, you are part of the occupation of Palestine.

**[11:35]** As long as you continue to uphold the Sykes-Picot borders, you are part of the problem in Palestine. And as long as you have not yet revolted against the rulers who restrict you in all directions, you are still part of the problem in Palestine. We ask Allah, the Almighty,

**[11:49]** to guide everyone to the right path, make us courageous, bear our responsibilities, inspire and support us until we reach the moment of resolution. And I say this statement of mine, seeking forgiveness, and victory belongs to the repentant. I seek forgiveness from Allah.

**[12:10]** Praise be to Allah. Then praise be to Allah.

**[12:14]** Praise be to Allah. Qasim Al-Jabari.

**[12:16]** Then praise be to Allah, a guide for the arrogant, and praise be to Allah, the supporter of the weak and truthful believers, even if after a while. And I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, alone with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger, chosen by Him. O servants of Allah, we are a nation awaiting the victory of Allah's servants, and Allah does not fail in His promise.

**[12:37]** However.

**[12:38]** Muslims always, and the righteous always, used to ask themselves a question, are we deserving of victory at this moment?

**[12:48]** When the answer is yes? And before you answer yes, you will see that the victory of Allah is within your reach.

**[12:54]** Therefore, when you see that victory has not yet descended, this means that we have not fulfilled the conditions of victory so far, and this is a tragic statement.

**[13:03]** When the level of sacrifices is at this level in one corner of the nation.

**[13:09]** And with these numbers.

**[13:11]** And in this manner, with the rest of the nation unable to achieve the entitlements of victory, this is a calamity.

**[13:21]** The core of our being should reciprocate, and the essence of the Islamic nation is to be ashamed of the people of Palestine.

**[13:27]** And to be ashamed of the people of Palestine.

**[13:29]** Those who sacrifice their youth and their children daily.

**[13:36]** And all that is required from the rest of the Islamic nation is not to sacrifice their children or their youth, but only

**[13:43]** to provide for the entitlements of victory.

**[13:47]** All that is required of them is to achieve the entitlements of victory, and the entitlements of victory for the servants of God are not difficult. The entitlements of victory are simply to become one nation, meaning to break the political boundaries in practice and

**[14:03]** to move towards the path of Allah, for they have entered the gate. This is what the Islamic nation has failed to do until now, the act of achieving Islamic unity and entering the gate. The people of Palestine are suffering, being killed, and destroyed, while the Islamic nation is helpless, or has not yet mustered a true determination and will to be deserving of victory.

**[14:24]** So, I ask Allah to inspire them with guidance, and to inspire them to prepare a leadership that will bring them back to the right path. O Allah, I am a supporter of their understanding.
